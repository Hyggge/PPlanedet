# PPlanedet: A development Toolkit for lane detection based on PaddlePaddle

In this project, we develop a toolkit for lane detection to facilitate research. Especially, PPlanedet is built upon [Paddleseg](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSeg) which is a development Toolkit for segmentation based on PaddlePaddle.

If you do not have enough compute resource, we recommend that you can run our project at [AiStudio](https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/index?ad-from=m-title), which can provide V100 with 32GB memory.
